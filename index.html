            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h3>An Aspiring Professional Web Developer</h3>
            <p>My desire to learn how to develop began around 2014 on a blogging platform called Tumblr. It all
                started when I wanted to customize the layout of the current theme I had applied to my blog. Then I
                wanted to add other features, like a music player at the bottom of the screen, a sidebar that
                remains on the left and right side even when the user would scroll down. The possibilities were
                endless! After going down a different path, I finally made the decision to formally learn how to
                develop by enrolling into the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp.</p>
