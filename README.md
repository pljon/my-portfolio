# My Portfolio

My first responsive website of my portfolio.

## Description

This project's objective was to build a responsive website using only HTML and CSS in the form of a portfolio. The project contains links that bring the user to their desired section (Home, About Me, Work, Contact) in a smooth transitional fashion. The header will remain visible at all times. This project also showcases works completed at the time, as JavaScript and Python were not visited during the assigned time of this project, they are only placeholders or examples of what may be there in the future.
